# 📄 scikick

An AI research companion — Chrome extension + local server. Brainstorm ideas, discuss your scientific writing, analyze data, and navigate peer review. Works with any scientific field.

## What it does

- **Chat with your papers** — Discuss manuscripts, figures, data, and reviewer feedback
- **Google Drive integration** — Load papers, figures, and documents directly from Drive
- **Cross-computer resume** — Session state saved to your Drive folder; pick up where you left off
- **Runs locally** — No hosting costs, your data stays on your machine
- **Streaming responses** — Real-time AI chat with streaming

## Architecture

```
Chrome Extension (side panel) ↔ Local Server (localhost:8742) ↔ Google Drive API + LLM API
```

- **Server**: Python/FastAPI
- **Extension**: Chrome Manifest V3 side panel
- **Memory**: `.scikick_memory.json` stored in your Google Drive project folder
- **AI**: Multi-provider — Anthropic Claude, DeepSeek, OpenAI, or any OpenAI-compatible API

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Chrome** (or Chromium-based browser: Edge, Brave, Arc)
- **LLM API key** from one of the supported providers (see below)
- **Google account** (any Gmail) — for Google Drive access

### Supported LLM Providers

| Provider | Get API key at | Default model |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Anthropic (Claude)** | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/) | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| **DeepSeek** | [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com/) | `deepseek-chat` |
| **OpenAI (GPT-4o)** | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/) | `gpt-4o` |
| **Custom** (Ollama, Groq, Together, etc.) | Your provider | Any |

### 1. Get the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JHCCoder/scikick.git
cd scikick
```

Or copy the folder from a USB stick / shared drive — no git required.

### 2. Run the setup wizard

```bash
./start.sh --setup
```

The wizard walks you through:
- Choosing your LLM provider and entering your API key
- Setting up Google Drive access (auto-opens each Google Cloud Console page for you, scans your Downloads for the credentials file, validates everything)

**This takes ~5 minutes** — most of that is clicking buttons in Google Cloud Console tabs that the wizard opens for you.

### 3. Start the server

The setup wizard asks if you want the server to start automatically on login (recommended). If you said yes, you're done — just click the extension.

Otherwise, start it manually:

```bash
./start.sh
```

Or install the background service later:

```bash
./start.sh --install-service
```

You should see:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Server:  http://localhost:8742
  Health:  http://localhost:8742/health
  API docs: http://localhost:8742/docs
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 4. Load the Chrome extension

```bash
./install-extension.sh
```

This auto-detects your browser, opens the extensions page, and copies the extension folder path to your clipboard.

Or manually:
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `extension/` folder from this project

### 5. Authenticate with Google (first time only)

Visit [http://localhost:8742/drive/auth/url](http://localhost:8742/drive/auth/url) in your browser, sign in with your Google account, and grant the requested permissions.

### 6. Load a project and start chatting

1. Click the scikick icon 📄 in your Chrome toolbar to open the side panel
2. Paste your Google Drive folder URL (or ID):
   ```
   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1abc123...
   ```
3. Click **Load Project**
4. Pick your interaction type (Brainstorming, Paper Discussion, etc.)

Ask questions like:
- "What are Reviewer 2's main concerns?"
- "Help me draft a response about Figure 3"
- "Does my Methods section address the concern about sample size?"
- "Compare what Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 said about the statistical analysis"
- "Help me rephrase this paragraph to be clearer"

---

## Google Drive Setup (re-run anytime)

```bash
./start.sh --setup
```

If LLM is already configured, the wizard skips straight to Google Drive setup.

### What the wizard does

The setup wizard treats Google Cloud Console as part of the app — it auto-opens each page you need and tells you exactly what to click:

| Step | What it opens | What you do |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | Project creation page | Click "Create" |
| 2 | Drive API page | Click "Enable" |
| 3 | Sheets API page | Click "Enable" |
| 4 | OAuth consent screen | Fill in app name, add scopes, add test user |
| 5 | Credentials page | Create OAuth client ID → Download JSON |
| 6 | (Local) | Wizard auto-finds the JSON in ~/Downloads, validates it, installs it |

## Project Folder Structure

Your Google Drive folder should look like this:

```
/My Paper Revision/
├── manuscript.pdf               # Your paper (PDF, DOCX, or Google Doc)
├── figures/
│   ├── fig1_methodology.png
│   ├── fig2_main_results.png
│   └── fig3_supplementary.png
├── supplementary/
│   ├── supp_table1.xlsx
│   └── supp_methods.pdf
├── reviewer_comments/            # Reviewer feedback
│   ├── reviewer_1.pdf
│   ├── reviewer_2.pdf
│   └── combined_comments.docx
├── response_letter.md            # Your draft response (optional)
└── .scikick_memory.json  # Auto-created session state
```

You can also use a **Google Sheet** for reviewer comments — the system auto-detects columns like "Reviewer", "Comment", "Severity", and "Response".

## Sharing with Labmates

Each person needs their own setup — scikick runs locally and uses personal API keys and Google credentials.

### For a labmate setting up from scratch

1. **Get the code**: `git clone https://github.com/JHCCoder/scikick.git` (or copy from a USB stick)
2. **Get an LLM API key**: Sign up at [DeepSeek](https://platform.deepseek.com/) (or Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
3. **Run the setup wizard**: `./start.sh --setup` — it guides you through Google Cloud setup and LLM config
4. **Start the server**: `./start.sh`
5. **Load the extension**: Run `./install-extension.sh` or follow the manual steps
6. **Authenticate**: Visit `http://localhost:8742/drive/auth/url`
7. **Load a project**: Paste a Google Drive folder URL and click Load Project

### Using the same Google Drive folder (collaborating)

If you want to work on the same paper together:
- Share the Google Drive folder with your labmate (via Google Drive's Share button)
- Each person uses their **own** Google OAuth credentials and LLM API key
- The `.scikick_memory.json` file syncs via Drive — you'll see each other's chat context
- Each person's LLM responses are independent (your API keys are separate)

### Cross-computer resume (same person, different machine)

Same as above — clone the code, run `./start.sh --setup` on the new machine (you'll need your Google credentials JSON again). Paste the same Drive folder ID and the server restores your session.

### Security

- **Never commit `google_credentials.json`, `google_token.json`, or `.env`** — they contain secrets
- `.gitignore` already excludes these
- Each person should use their own Google Cloud OAuth client and API key
- Local data (`~/.scikick/`) contains tokens — don't share that folder

## Configuration

### LLM Provider

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | `anthropic` | Provider: `anthropic`, `deepseek`, `openai`, or `custom` |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | (required) | Your API key |
| `LLM_MODEL` | (provider default) | Model name override |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | (provider default) | Base URL for custom providers |

These are saved to `.env` by the setup wizard.

### Server

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `REVISION_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Server bind address |
| `REVISION_PORT` | `8742` | Server port |
| `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` | `~/.scikick/google_credentials.json` | Path to Google OAuth credentials |

### Switching providers later

Run `./start.sh --setup` again, or edit `.env` directly and restart the server.

## Troubleshooting

**Server won't start — "No LLM API key found"**
Run `./start.sh --setup` to configure your API key, or create a `.env` file with `LLM_API_KEY=your-key-here`.

**"Google credentials not found" when starting**
Run `./start.sh --setup` to run the guided Google Drive setup wizard.

**Extension side panel shows "Server disconnected"**
Make sure the server is running (`./start.sh`). The status dot in the top bar should be green.

**Google auth page says "Error: redirect_uri_mismatch"**
Make sure you created an OAuth client ID of type "Desktop application" (not "Web application"). Re-run `./start.sh --setup` to redo the credentials.

**"This app isn't verified" warning during Google sign-in**
This is normal for a local app. Click "Advanced" → "Go to scikick (unsafe)" to continue. You added yourself as a test user during setup, so this works.

## Tips

- **Use a Google Sheet for reviewer comments** — easier to track status and add draft responses
- **Name figures clearly** — `fig2_main_results.png` is better than `IMG_4829.png`
- **Keep the server running** — it's lightweight and stateless between requests
- **The memory file is human-readable** — you can inspect or edit `.scikick_memory.json` in your Drive folder
